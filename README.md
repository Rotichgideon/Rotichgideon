Hey I'm Gideon

I'm a software engineer with a love of front-end web development. I'm currently working with React to create easy-to-use and beautiful web apps. I strive to make the technology industry more accessible to aspiring developers and engineers by creating content to share the mistakes I have made and lessons I've learned along my software engineering journey so far.
